# LaLiga Project

This project was created for a university course and is written in Jupyter Notebook. It uses data from a CSV file on LaLiga and player statistics.

 It included a Jupyter notebook embedded in an iframe, which was used to analyze statistics for the LaLiga soccer league and FC Barcelona. The notebook likely contained code for collecting, cleaning, and manipulating data about the league and team, as well as visualizing and summarizing the results of the analysis. The web application likely allowed users to interact with the results of the analysis, either by viewing the notebook directly or through additional features and visualizations implemented in the Flask app. The goal of the project may have been to provide insights about the performance of the LaLiga league and FC Barcelona, or to allow users to explore and analyze the data in a more interactive and user-friendly way.

 To run the project you need to enter the folder "INZYNIERIADANYCH" in your terminal, copy this command: flask --app main.py and then click enter
