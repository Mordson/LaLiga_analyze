# LaLiga Project

This project was created for a university course and is written in Jupyter Notebook. It uses data from a CSV file on LaLiga and player statistics.

The project consists of the following files:

LaLiga.ipynb: This is the main Jupyter Notebook file containing the code and visualizations.
LaLiga.csv: This is the CSV file containing the data used in the project.
The project visualizes the position of FC Barcelona in 2019 and the statistics of FC Barcelona players. To run the project, simply open the LaLiga.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook and run the code cells.
