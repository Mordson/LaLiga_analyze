        <center><h1> LaLiga Project </h1></center>
          <p>This project was a web application built using the Flask framework. It included a Jupyter notebook embedded in an iframe, 
            which was used to analyze statistics for the LaLiga soccer league and FC Barcelona. The notebook likely contained code for 
            collecting, cleaning, and manipulating data about the league and team, as well as visualizing and summarizing the results of the 
            analysis. The web application likely allowed users to interact with the results of the analysis, 
            by viewing the notebook directly in IFrame. 
            The goal of the project may have been to provide insights about the performance of the LaLiga league and FC Barcelona, 
            or to allow users to explore and analyze the data in a more interactive and user-friendly way.
